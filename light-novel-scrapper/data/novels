  "description": "Allison is an adventure series set in a world containing one continent (extending roughly from the Equator to 60 degrees North latitude) which is divided down the center by a towering mountain range and a huge river. The industry and technology of the world are roughly equivalent to Europe in the 1930s. Due to the geography, two cultures developed on either side of the divide, and at the time the story begins, the cultures have been at war on and off for hundreds of years. The bloodiest conflict yet began thirty-five years before the start of the story; both sides are so exhausted by the conflict that an uneasy armistice is signed after some five years of fighting. Aside from a brief conflict over the jurisdiction of the river, resulting in the formation of a buffer zone on either side, this peace has largely been unbroken. The east side of the world is known as Roxche, though formally the region's name is the Roxcheanuk Confederation. The entire region comprises sixteen countries which all speak a common language. The west side is known as Sou Beil, though formally the region's name is the Allied Kingdoms of Bezel Iltoa. The region comprises the two kingdoms of Bezel and Iltoa which both serve to bring together a small number of countries under a common language different than that of the eastern region. There are far more blond-haired people in the West than the East.\nAt the beginning of the first novel, Allison, a pilot in the Roxche Air Force, has come to visit her childhood friend Wilhelm (\"Wil\" for short), who has remained at school over his summer break to continue his studies. While traveling in the countryside near the school, the two encounter an old man well-known to Wil's schoolmates as a teller of tall tales. Nevertheless, he captures their interest with his talk about a \"treasure\" which, if found, is said to be able to put an end to the war. No one would believe him that the war between the countries could ever end, so no one listened to him. When the old man is abducted and taken over to Sou Beil, Allison and Wil steal an airplane and chase the abductors across the river into the next region. Fortunately, the two were raised as orphans by a woman who came from the West, and thus can speak both languages.\n ",

The autistic younger brother and his older brother share a very special bond, and this story goes into great detail about how this came to be, how they dealt with it and how it altered their futures. This story also stands out among BL novels in that it explores China in the 80s in great depth, as our protagonists live through major events in the country at that time.\nThere will be explicit content between the brothers, so I warn those against incest to stop here and save yourselves the anguish.\nI hope this story will also raise more awareness for autism, bullying, and bullying involving autistic children. I study psychology as my major and know quite a bit about autism. I think the story did a decent job portraying an autistic person, but if you are autistic yourself, or know someone close who is, and find this portrayal to be inaccurate, please let me know.\n ",

And hence, a friendship which turned into more started to form between the two most unlikely characters.\n ",

Possessing technology and combat capabilities far more advanced than any other weapon system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overpowering weapon, the nations of the world enact the \"Alaska Treaty\", which states that IS will never be used for military combat and that existing IS technology must be equally distributed to all nations, to prevent any one nation for dominating the others. The introduction of the IS does however have a major effect on society. As IS can only be operated by women, the power balance between men and women is broken, with women coming to dominate society over men.\nTen years after the first IS were introduced, the world has entered a new age of peace. The peace is shattered, however, by an unexpected discovery. A 15 year old Japanese boy, named Ichika Orimura, is discovered to be capable of operating an IS. Realizing the potential, Ichika is forced by the Japanese government to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy, an international academy where IS pilots from all over the world are trained. Thus his busy school life surrounded by girls begins.\n ",

  "description": "Welcome to the world of Kancolle RPG! This book tells a story about a novice admiral and his interesting kanmusu (ship girls). But, this book is a little different from a normal story. This book, tells a, Roleplaying, story.\nRoleplaying, is a type of game that you play with other people where you read lines from the book as if youre the one in the story. There are a lot of Roleplaying, types and this book is specifically a, Table talk, RPG. Read it as if youre playing kantai collection- Kancole- Kancolle RPG.\nThis Kancolle RPG is based on a browser game called Kantai Collection. The game itself puts the player in control of girls that have the memories and powers of warships in the past. The player then must battle a mysterious threat called the Abyssal Fleet, sighted all around the world. The difference between Kancolle RPG and the browser game, is that youll need to use dice, pieces, and follow the rules and scenarios stated by the Kancolle RPG rulebook. Obtaining ship girls are different too; each player will only get one shipgirl. In table talk RPG, you can ease your mind, the rage, the salt that naturally comes while playing, by gathering friends who have the same hobby, and discuss while playing.\nSometimes youll need to face the enemy seriously. Sometimes, you can put yourself in the ship girls shoes, and act out their lines. Sometimes youll have to go back to yourself, and joke at other characters line. You playing it happily with your friends are what Roleplaying, is all about.\nA Battleship girl who has just come back from another country, she is generous and having a big heart, Kongou.\nA Heavy Cruiser princess with a lack of common sense, Kumano.\nAn eccentric Light Aircraft Carrier, Zuihou.\nThe serious and analytical Light Cruiser, Kiso.\nThese are the main girls who play a big part in this book. But, due to the haphazard nature of this game, you wont be able to play their characters perfectly. Even if you try to, but deep inside, the girls you know are different. Nevertheless, we hope you would be able to enjoy that character gap.\nAnd lastly, well introduce another one of the main characters, Teitoku (the Admiral). He is a young and by-the-book admiral. This novice Admiral is often being played around by the 4 wild girls. He still thinks that, It shouldnt be like that, its not like that.\" This hard working Admiral is one of the view points we will be using in this book.\nFrom now, for everyone whose thinking, Id like to be an admiral in kancolle RPG! please try it. It will be a good reference!\n ",

At this stage, a small archipelago called the Divine States were the only hospitable land on Earth. In order to regain the space-faring technology they had lost after many years of war, they decided to recreate history with a book called the Testament as a guide. \nIt is the year 1648 in the Testament Era. Toori Aoi, Chancellor and Student Council President of the only academy on the airborne city-ship Musashi, faces the ten-year anniversary of the death of his childhood friend Horizon Ariadust in an accident. As he prepares to celebrate the occasion by proposing to P-01s (an automaton who looks exactly like Horizon) he discovers that his suspicion about P-01s appearance actually has a basis in truth; P-01s is in fact Horizon Ariadust, reborn into a robotic body. In addition to this, Horizons emotions had been stripped away and are now stored in eight powerful weapons called the Mortal Sin Armaments; which are now in the possession of key people in various established countries in the Divine States.\nTo retrieve the emotions of Horizon Ariadust, Toori Aoi along with his friends and allies begins a crusade against different obstacles as key events in history are recreated in a futuristic manner.\n ",

  "description": "The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the late 36th century. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.\nWithin the Galactic Empire, based on mid 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.\nIn the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen Li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.\nAs a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.\nBesides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters, from high nobility, admirals and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers, are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.\nThere is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire called the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) which trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which claims that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story executive political figures of Phezzan in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war so that it may favor their objectives.\n ",

But now, when she saw him, he had returned to the secular life and carried a gun on him. \nShe inadvertently gets to know this man, Cheng Muyun, more, and each time, as another layer of him is revealed, she is both terrified and drawn to him. A rogue? A criminal? Or something else? Dangerous, yes. Yet, he can be so tender. But always magnetic. \nWith each step closer that she gets to him, though, Wen Han, an ordinary, 1/4-Chinese girl from Moscow, is drawn more into a dangerous, frightening world she had never before imagined. And with each step, as she understands this man named Cheng Muyun more, her heart falls more for him, deeper and deeper, until the thought of being apart from him is too hard to bear. But, they are fated to separatefrom the very first day, he had told her that.\n ",

The mythical beings will choose their summoners on their 14th birthday and give them a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsman (basically bodyguards that give the summoners time to cast their spell) as a result.\n15 years later after the finding of magic Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. This is surprising since males arent chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to be a summoner Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone.\nTo complicate matters his sister (whos a magical swordsman) is against him going into summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman have a cat mouse thing going on where summoners look down on magical swordsman as inferior so his sister naturally is against him going there. Shell stop him even if it means going to war.\nKazuki however is determined to thrive in summoner school and has already determined to give it his all.

This girl child is the third daughter of Ning Guos Prime Minister Li and his seventh wife. Her name is Li Qing Luo and because her mother was originally from an entertainment house, Prime Minister Li and his other six wives treated them badly.\nHer first day in that world, the whole family gathers to test the talent of the three daughters. Qing Lei, the eldest, is talented at playing the zither while Qing Feis calligraphy is incomparable. Everyone anticipates A'Luos failure as she had not exhibited any talent before, but that six year old child recites a famous Tang poem. The entire family is surprised that Qing Luo is able to write such a profound poem and her mother later tells her that Prime Minister Li is so harsh on his daughters because he needs to rely on them marrying well to secure his future. Qing Luo begins to study qin, qi, shu, hua (zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting) but hides her skill because she does not want to be sold in marriage to some prince or court official.\nSix years later, A'Luo is now twelve and leaves the estate for the first time to participate at a flower viewing banquet. This is a special banquet because the Five Most Eligible Bachlors of Feng Cheng will be in attendance (theres actually a more elegant name for them).

At Lillian Girls School, there is a tradition known as the sur system (sur being French for sister ) , in which a second, or third-year student, the grande sur (big sister ) , will give her rosary to a junior student, the petite sur (little sister ) , and promise to look after them and guide them.\nWhen the story begins, Yumi Fukuzawa, a new first-year student admitted to Lillian, is praying in front of the Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumis uniform ribbon. This seemingly simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day, and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch. After school is over, Yumis classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi to show her that she took a photograph of Yumis meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning. Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachikos permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, which sets in motion a series of events involving the entire Yamayurikai  the student council of the school. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachikos rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sur.\nThis officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayurikai where she assists them in school matters at the same level as the other two petite surs  Yoshino Shimazu, and Shimako Toudou  who are the petite surs of Rei Hasekura, and Sei Satou respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayurikai, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.\nThis was the original novel that the Manga and Anime are based on.\n ",

The story that begins here revolves around stories brought forth by them.\nAnd this story, it can also be said to be the story of it and I.\nAs its eyes glimmer in front of strangeness, as it breathes out words with a bedazzled expression, it warped the world that I always believed in. It made me anxious of whether the ground I stood on would shake. I would want to look over my shoulder just by listening, and I grew to fear whether someone were peeking from the dark shadow of the door.\nMaybe it was because the words it spoke included truths about the other side. It included truths that only applied to the scant, grotesque, waning, dead ones.\nNow, after it has disappeared, do I finally know that.\nAs grandmother said, it was a world that I should not have seen. It was a story that was not for the living person.\nHowever.\nHowever, I intend to speak of that.\nI intend to speak about all of that.\nBecause if I don't  it wouldn't be able to rest in peace.\nBecause it, having lived on the edge of darkness, having struggled through the threshold of darkness, would not be able to live in peace.\nYes  I'll say it once more.\nFrom here on, is a story that shouldn't be known.\n ",

In both the novels and manga, her adventures alternate between doing missions for the British Library and helping young novelist Nenene Sumiregawa.\nOnly the first novel and first manga have similar stories, involving rescuing Nenene Sumiregawa from a vicious kidnapper. Otherwise, the novels, manga, and animated versions of the stories have divergent plotlines. While characterizations are usually consistent even when storylines are not, some characters have different origins in different versions of the story, or do not appear at all. Still, it's mostly an ongoing story told through different media from the novels to the animated series so far.\n ",

Though the school and its students were never proven to be real, or maybe they were just made up by a few people who managed to visit the place and came back.\nIt was even more of a taboo to mention any of these rumors because the people who did discuss what they saw in the nesting ground of the evil creatures vanished one by one and their whereabouts were unknown. Many speculated that they were abducted by the evil creatures who reside in the evil nest and others foretold that they were cursed by the evil creatures because of what they have voiced out about the said place.\nAnd it was then that the place was called The Den of Evil, so it was prohibited by the government to visit or even get near the place, because of the dangers that await those that dared go there. Until now the place remained a mystery and for whatever creatures lived in that place.\n ",

Seimei passed his teachings on to his grandson Masahiro, who has lost his sixth sense and the ability to see spirits. Masahiro constantly feels resentful for being in his grandfathers shadow.\nEven so, one day, Masahiro meets a fox-like creature which he names Mokkun, who shows him his true powers after fighting a demon. Mokkun is actually Toda who prefers to be called Guren. He is one of the twelve shikigami called the Shinsho, who has pledged his loyalty to Seimei and is helping Masahiro surpass his grandfather.\nMasahiros dream to surpass his grandfather may not be realised easily as not only does he have to convince the other Shinsh that he is Seimeis true successor, he must also increase his power in order to stop the demons coming over from China, the other parts of Japan, the Underworld, as well as rival onmyjis who want to destroy Japan. He also has to keep his promise to protect Princess Akiko of the Fujiwara clan.\n ",

Although the book is often referred to as a wuxia novel, it is not archetypal of the genre, since the protagonist, Wei Xiaobao, is not an adept martial artist, but rather, an antihero who relies on wit and cunning to get out of trouble.

The story has undergone two revisions. The second edition was released in 1979 and and the third edition was published in 2005.\nSet in the late Yuan dynasty, the story revolves around a pair of priceless and extremely powerful weapons, the Heaven Reliant Sword () and Dragon Slaying Saber (), which are coveted by many martial artists in the jianghu. Either or both of them are thought to allow their wielder to rule the wulin (martial artists' community), according to a widely circulated mantra which goes, \"Honoured by the wulin, the precious Saber slays the Dragon. It commands the world. Who dares to disobey? If the Heaven Reliant does not appear, who can challenge it?\" (). The origins of this mantra are not known at the beginning of the story.\nThe protagonist, Zhang Wuji, is of mixed heritage: His father, Zhang Cuishan, is an apprentice of Zhang Sanfeng, the highly revered leader of the Wudang Sect; his mother, Yin Susu, is the daughter of Yin Tianzheng, the chief of the \"unorthodox\" Heavenly Eagle Cult. He spent his childhood on a reclusive northern island, where he was born, with only his parents and his godfather, Xie Xun, to keep him company. When he is about 10 years old, he returns to the Chinese mainland with his parents. They soon find themselves the target of several martial artists, who try to force them to reveal the whereabouts of Xie Xun and the Dragon Slaying Saber. His parents refuse and commit suicide. At the same time, Zhang Wuji is wounded by the Xuanming Elders, but he survives after seeking medical treatment from Hu Qingniu, an eccentric physician.\n ",

Dying does not come true, every day passes idly.\nLike that one day, a mere solitary girl appeared before the Maou.\nUnintentionally the Maou had become immortal.\nThe hero who was ignorant of failure.\nThe moment the pair met, the story that had came to a halt once again begun to spin.\n- - - - - \nMore detailed description by Faw:\nThe demon king was summoned from Japan to fight off the hero. After a long grueling fight I finally won against the hero. But something strange happened. After he had defeated but not killed the hero the holy sword floated up and stabbed the hero in the chest and then immediately disappeared. And this isnt the only time it happened. Every hero after that that wielded the holy sword was killed by it immediately after the hero lost to the demon king.\nThe demon king was heartbroken upon witnessing this\nHe tried different ways to save the heroes from their fate.\nHe tried destroying the sword but that was impossible.\nHe tried stealing the sword but it always kept disappearing.\nHe tried telling the heroes the truth about the sword but most wont believe him.\nAnd those that did believe him were immediately killed by the sword.\nThe demon king watched this go on for nearly 500 years repeatedly. And with each hero he defeat he gets stronger and stronger to the point where no hero can beat him anymore. He had gotten so powerful that the holy sword cant even harm him anymore.\nHe had given up on life and tried to kill himself. But he had already gotten so strong he had achieved pseudo-immortality and even he couldnt kill himself.\nSo for 500 years he was continually tormented by that sword. The sword took everything from him.\nIt took his friends, his family,and his lovers.\nAnd so the demon king sits in an empty castle in seclusion waiting for the next hero to come to their death.\nUntil one day a young hero girl came to his castle.. without the holy sword.\nShe was apparently a newly summoned hero that wasnt deemed worthy by the sword.\nThis was the happiest moment of the demon Kings life\n ",

How hilarious was it when he met a ghost?

He was just watching a movie on television, Li Xiaolongs Way of the Dragon movie. It was then that dad suddenly experienced a heavenly revelation and pounded the table: Its Li Xiaolong!. And thus, due to such a heavenly coincidence, my father named me Xiaolong after Bruce Lees name. Since the beginning when I was born, bad luck always followed me and ONLY happened to me, I even almost died electrocuted when I was peeing under the electric pole.\nIt wasnt until one day:\nSince you were born, no matter how dangerous the things that happened around you, you didnt die right? That was because of the Red Arrow mark. Great misfortune will always follow you until youre dead. Only by practicing Taoism will you be rid of this predicament.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThough timid, Xiaolong himself was a bit superstitious but that did not outweigh his disbelief, reluctantly he believed the dying old man, even if it felt like the old swindler was just making another joke out of him. It wasnt until when he was shown what a ghost would look like did he start to accept the reality.\nThe dying old man eventually died, and his spirit proved to him that he was seeing the real thing. He left him a legacy of 50 thousand RMB in cash, and 1.5  million debt in papers. But his most important legacy were the Dao teachings compiled in a thick book and his follower, the ancient female high-leveled spirit, Murong Daiyu who became Xiaolong`s half-master afterward.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe female spirit said gently: You are now the succeeding disciple of 54th Bull Celestial Daoist Master, as well as the sole candidate for 55th generation head.\nWait a minute, I interrupted: I only heard about Celestial Master Zhang Daoling who found The Way of Celestial Masters, Ive never heard about this Bull Celestial Master\n ",

A world that has recovered to a state that is roughly equal to our own world in terms of technology and culture, although its ancient history remains largely unknown. The story begins during the post-graduation trip of our protagonist, where he discovers some ancient ruins and witnesses the great change, an upheaval that changed everything. The changing earth not only brought about new, unexplored landscape but also sparked the evolution of all organisms. Plants and animals started gaining sentience and some humans obtained unimaginable powers. The legends, myths, and tales of old seemed to have suddenly come to life as the earth entered a new era where beasts and men formed factions, explored new lands and ultimately struggled for supremacy.\nWe follow the MC as he grows from being an eccentric young man into a badass expert warrior while meeting other funny characters and forming brotherly bonds. We watch as he falls into just as much hilarious situations as he does perilous ones, all the while wondering and slowly discovering the mysteries of this world. Just why was the world destroyed in the first place? Who or what had triggered this earth-shattering change? What profundities lie behind the process of evolution?\n ",

His father's brother plotted against his father which resulted in the Xuan family giving a million miles chase.\nThe Huang family members were all injured, many died. He himself almost died, if it wasnt for his grandpa who took the final blow for him. His grandpa, once a strong fighter, is now crippled. All his remaining family members dropped in fighting power due to their injuries.\nXuan Tians cultivation is now also limited due to his injuries as a child. Nevertheless, he entered a sword school and worked hard to gain enough power for revenge and to cure his family.\nThis was hopeless as his cultivation is painstakingly slow. Until one time he fell into a pond where a sword spirit entered his body, curing his injuries.\n ",

There is no flowery rhetoric here, only simple retellings, like a friend from your class telling you of some past memories from their youth, and thus makes up this interesting literary work.\nThe new Holy Angels Edition brings you an additional 18 new stories penned by well-known intellectual and TV host Kevin Tsai, as well as entirely new illustrations from the creative mind of Cola King.\n(First Edition)\nWhen the unique world of Kevin Tsai meets Sunny Faces charming illustrations, comes the vivid reproduction of boys from Tsais memory .\nNumbering those boys was just a convenient way for me to remember them and write about them, there wasnt any significance to it. Also, I just wanted to write about some of the boys that Ive encountered in my life, its just as simple as that . Kevin Tsai\nWhen it comes to boys, everyone has a bunch of stories they could write, but only Kevin Tsai is able to produce page after page of interesting stories about them. Upon first look at the descriptions in the book, its quite surprising to feel a sense of familiarity, despite these being boys in the authors life. Even in some seemingly dark and hopeless instances, you can still find a glimmer of light from love and emotions, as well as dark humour that will make you smile knowingly. Paired with delicate illustrations by Sunny Face that Tsai has handpicked, each boy is able to come alive on the pages, leaping into your sight, like the boys you knew from long ago returning to your memory .\n ",

  "description": "White Horse Neighing in the West Wind by Jin Yong was first serialized in the newspapers in 1961.\nLi Wenxiu, a young Han Chinese maiden, loses her parents in the Gobi Desert while escaping from a group of bandits who are after a map of the Gaochang labyrinth. Placed on a white steed, she flees to Kazakh territory and is taken into the care of Old Man Ji, an elderly Han Chinese man. While growing up, she meets Supu, a Kazakh boy, and starts a romance with him. However, Supu's father disapproves of the relationship between his son and a Han Chinese girl, so they are forced to separate.\nSeveral years later, Li Wenxiu meets Hua Hui, a hermit, in an oasis in the Gobi Desert, and helps him cure his wounds. Hua Hui feels grateful to her and accepts her as his apprentice and teaches her martial arts. She returns home in the midst of heavy snowfall and sees Supu, his father, and his new lover taking shelter in her house. Chen Dahai, the leader of the group of bandits who killed Li Wenxiu's parents, arrives at Li's home and suspects that the map he has been hunting for is inside the house. He ransacks the house for the map and eventually finds it. The secret of the map is revealed when blood is spilled onto the cloth. Chen wants to silence Supu and the others but is stopped and defeated by Li, who has disguised herself as an old man.\nChen Dahai flees with the map and finds his way to the labyrinth, while Li Wenxiu and Supu gather five others to join them in pursuing Chen and the bandits. The seven of them make their way to the labyrinth, where they are surprised to find ordinary items associated with Han Chinese culture instead of treasure and riches as they expected. To their horror, they encounter a \"ghost\" who haunts them by killing their companions without leaving any traces. Just as they are about to flee, Supu learns that his lover has been kidnapped by the \"ghost\" and he tracks the \"ghost\" to its lair in the labyrinth, where he discovers that the \"ghost\" is actually a martial arts expert in disguise.\nThe \"ghost\" tells his story and reveals that he was forced into exile because he was betrayed by his apprentice, who is actually Old Man Ji. The \"ghost\" is the hermit Hua Hui, whom Li Wenxiu saved earlier. To everyone's surprise, Old Man Ji is revealed to be actually a man in his 30s in disguise as an old man. Old Man Ji and Hua Hui start fighting with each other. Li is shocked to realise that the two, who are close to her, are actually enemies. Hua Hui eventually dies in his futile attempt to kill everyone in the labyrinth. After leaving the labyrinth, Li Wenxiu hears the true story behind the items hidden in the labyrinth and their origins. She decides to leave the land for central China as she feels miserable after the loss of two of her loved ones and the marriage of her lover to another woman.\n ",
